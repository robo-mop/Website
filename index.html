        <div class="content">Wanted in 7 continents for manipulating the Amul Lassi stock market, I had to do whatever I could to survive. That meant doing things normal humans wouldn't dream of doing, like using Python in coding contests. And Murder.</div>
        <div class="content">Fortunately, I diguised myself as a 19-year-old Economics Undergraduate at BITS Goa. Every day I run away from my past, and also from Probability and Statistics questions.</div>
        <div class="content">One day, I'll have to face the consequences of my actions, and that scares me.</div>
